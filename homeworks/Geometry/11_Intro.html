  <div class="hw-reading" style="max-width: 900px; margin: 24px auto; padding: 0 14px;">
    <h2>Reading: What Does “Volume” Mean?</h2>

    <p>
      When we say that a box has volume <strong>24 cubic units</strong>, we mean something very concrete:
      if we filled the box with little cubes of size \(1\times1\times1\), exactly 24 of them would fit.
    </p>

    <p>
      That simple idea — <strong>counting cubes</strong> — is the starting point of volume.
      Geometry wants a definition that still makes sense for shapes that are not easy to fill directly
      with cubes, such as pyramids, cones, and spheres. So we write down rules that any reasonable
      “amount of space” must satisfy. These rules are called <strong>postulates</strong>.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Postulate 1 — The unit cube sets the scale</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine measuring length without deciding what “1 unit” means. The numbers would be meaningless.
      Volume works the same way. We choose a standard piece of space: the cube with side length 1.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Postulate:</strong> The volume of the unit cube is defined to be 1.</p>

    <h3>Postulate 2 — Moving a solid does not change its volume</h3>
    <p>
      If you rotate a box, slide it across the floor, or flip it over, it does not suddenly contain
      more or less space. A solid that is the same shape and size is the same solid, even if moved.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Postulate:</strong> Solids that are the same shape and size (even if moved or rotated) have the same volume.</p>

    <h3>Postulate 3 — Volumes add when pieces do not overlap</h3>
    <p>
      If you cut a solid cleanly into pieces and keep all the pieces, you have not lost or created space.
      So the whole volume should equal the sum of the parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overlap matters: if pieces overlap, you would count the overlapping space twice.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Postulate:</strong> The volume of a solid equals the sum of the volumes of its non-overlapping parts.</p>

    <h3>Postulate 4 — Volume cannot be negative</h3>
    <p>
      You can have some space, or no space, but not “negative space.”
    </p>
    <p><strong>Postulate:</strong> Every solid has volume \(\ge 0\).</p>

    <p>
      A key consequence: if one solid fits entirely inside another, it cannot have greater volume.
      Intuitively, the bigger solid is the smaller solid plus some leftover space — and leftover space
      cannot be “negative.”
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
      These postulates explain why volume formulas are not magic:
      for example, the box formula \(V=lwh\) comes from packing the box with unit cubes and adding.
      They also justify “cut-and-rearrange” reasoning: if you cut a solid and rebuild it with
      <strong>no gaps and no overlaps</strong>, the volume stays the same.
