      <h2>Reading: What Does <span class="accent">Volume</span> Mean?</h2>

      <p>
        When we say that a box has volume <span class="pill">24 cubic units</span>, we mean something very concrete:
        if we filled the box with little cubes of size \(1\times1\times1\), exactly <strong>24</strong> of them would fit.
      </p>

      <p class="fine">
        That idea—<span class="term">counting cubes</span>—is the starting point. But geometry wants a definition that
        still makes sense for shapes that are not easy to fill directly with cubes (pyramids, cones, spheres).
        So we write down rules that any reasonable “amount of space” must satisfy. These rules are called
        <span class="term">postulates</span>.
      </p>

      <div class="hr"></div>

      <div class="postulate">
        <div class="title">Postulate 1 — The unit cube sets the scale</div>
        <div class="line">
          Imagine measuring length without agreeing on what “1 unit” means—numbers would be meaningless.
          Volume works the same way.
        </div>
        <div class="line">
          <span class="ruleword">Postulate:</span> We define \(V(\text{unit cube})=1\).
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="postulate">
        <div class="title">Postulate 2 — Moving a solid does not change its volume</div>
        <div class="line">
          If you rotate a box, slide it, or flip it over, it does not suddenly contain more (or less) space.
        </div>
        <div class="line">
          <span class="ruleword">Postulate:</span> Same shape and size (even if moved) ⇒ same volume.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="postulate">
        <div class="title">Postulate 3 — Volumes add when pieces do not overlap</div>
        <div class="line">
          If you cut a solid cleanly and keep all pieces, you did not destroy or create space.
          So the whole should equal the sum of its parts.
        </div>
        <div class="line">
          <span class="ruleword">Postulate:</span> If pieces do not overlap, then
          \(V(\text{whole})=V(\text{part 1})+\cdots\).
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="callout">
        <div class="title">Why “no overlap” matters</div>
        <div class="line">
          If two pieces overlap, you would count the overlapping region <strong>twice</strong>.
          That would inflate the total and break the meaning of measurement.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="postulate">
        <div class="title">Postulate 4 — Volume cannot be negative</div>
        <div class="line">
          You can have some space, or no space, but not “negative space.”
        </div>
        <div class="line">
          <span class="ruleword">Postulate:</span> Every solid has \(V\ge 0\).
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="fine">
        A key consequence: if solid \(A\) fits inside solid \(B\), then \(A\) cannot have greater volume.
        Intuitively, \(B\) is “\(A\) plus leftover space,” and leftover space cannot be negative.
      </p>

      <div class="hr"></div>

      <p class="fine">
        These postulates explain why volume formulas are not magic. For example, \(V=lwh\) for a box comes from
        packing it with unit cubes and adding (no overlap). They also justify <span class="term">cut-and-rearrange</span>
        reasoning: if you cut a solid and rebuild it with <strong>no gaps</strong> and <strong>no overlaps</strong>,
        the volume stays the same.
      </p>
